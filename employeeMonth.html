        <p class = "fw-light">Stowell has acted as the head of MSF's US COVID-19 response team since 2020, and has done an amazing job of reaching out to vulnerable communities in these unprescedented times.</p>
        <p class = "fw-light">Most recently, she and her team have acted in Immokalee, Florida to provide COVID-19 testing and general public health activities to a group of migrant workers who were at a high risk for transmission of the virus. Before the arrival of the respinse team, COVID-19 testing was not easily accessable for farm workers who worked long hours, often for 6-7 days a week. Thanks to the outreach, testing is now available 6 days of the week, including 3 days a week where the sites are open dueing the evening and night. Barriers caused by language were also removed, as there are now staff available onsite that speak Spanish and Creole.</p>
        <p class = "fw-light">We took the time out to interview the awardee, who thanked those who have supported her from the beginning. She fondly recalled that "...time on the Fletcher Allen Response Team has really impacted who [she] is today..." and that she wouldn't be where she is now without them.</p>
