        <p class = "fw-lighter d-flex">March 25, 2020 - Updated August 2021</p>
        <p class = "fw-light">COVID-19 is a respiratory disease caused by SARS-CoV-, a new, aggressive form of the coronavirus first discovered in 2019. The virus primarily spreads through droplets produced by an infected person coughing, sneezing, or talking.</p>
        <p class = "fw-light">Symptoms can vary between individuals from mild to severe. Generally, those over the age of 65 or anyone with any underlying medical condition are among those with the highest risk to experience serious illness.</p>
        <h3 class = "fw-bold">How can you help stop the spread?</h3>
        <ol class = "fw-normal">
          <li class = "fs-4">Get vaccinated</li>
          <p class = "mb-2 fw-light">Authorized vaccinations for COVID-19 help protect your body from the symptoms of the virus. In order to prevent infectio, the vaccine should be administered as soon as possible. Once you have recieved two doses and are fully vaccinated, you may be able to start doing things you were forced to give up due to the pandemic.</p>
          <li  class = "fs-4">Wear a mask</li>
          <p class = "mb-2 fw-light">Coronavirus is most commonly spread to others through the creation of rspiratory droplets. Prevent the entry of these harmful particles into your mouth and nose by wearing a mask.</p>
          <p class = "mb-2 fw-light">Those two years of age or older should wear a mask in indoor public spaces. Masks are not required in public outdoor spaces unless you live in an area with a high number of cases, or if you will be participating in activities that involve close contact with others who are not fully vaccinated.</p>
          <li class = "fs-4">Stay 6 feet away from others in public</li>
          <p class = "mb-2 fw-light">Inside the home, avoid close contact with sick individuals. Outside the home, stay at least 6 feet away from those who are not in your immediate household. People are able to spread the virus asymptomatically, so try to keep your distance, especially if you are at a higher risk of severe illness.</p>
          <li class = "fs-4">Wash your hands often</li>
          <p class= "mb-2 fw-light">be sure to wash your hands with soap and warm water for at leats 20 seconds several times a day. Especially if you have been in a public place, or after blowing your nose, coughing, or sneezing to prevent potential coronavirus particles from spreading to surfaces you've touched.</p>
          <p class= "mb-2 fw-light">Additionally, try to avoid touching your eyes, nose, or mouth with unwashed hands to prevent the spread of germs inside your body. If you can't access soap and water readily, a hand santizer that contains 60% alcohol may serve as an acceptable substitute in emergencies.</p>
          <li class = "fs-4">Clean and disinfect dirty surfaces</li>
          <p class= "mb-2 fw-light">Surfaces that are touched often, also known as "high traffic" surafces, have the potential to carry foreign germs. Be sure to wipe down and disinfect any commonly used objects if you have had visitors, such as door knobs, countertops, or keyboards.</p>
          <p class= "mb-2 fw-light"> This action is doubly important if someone in yourhousehold has tested positive for COVID-19. Be sure to disinfect anything they may have touched that is shared more often then usual. Household cleaning products from the <a href = "https://www.epa.gov/coronavirus/about-list-n-disinfectants-coronavirus-covid-19-0">EPA's List N: Disinfectants for Coronavirus</a> should be used for maximum safety.</p>
          <li class = "fs-4">Cover coughs and sneezes</li>
          <p class= "mb-2 fw-light">If you are wearing a mask, it is acceptable to cough and or sneeze into it, as long as you ensure that it is replaced with a new, clean mask, and that you wash your hands afterwords.</p>
          <p class= "mb-2 fw-light">If you are not wearing a mask, be sure to cover your mouth and nose with a tissue or the inside of your elbow. Dispose of used tissues properly and wash you hands immediatly after with soap and water or hand sanitizer.</p>
          <li class = "fs-4">Quarantine</li>
          <p class= "mb-2 fw-light">If you test positive for COVID-19, it is imperative that you isolate yourself from others as soon as possible.</p>
          <p class= "mb-2 fw-light">If you suspect, or have been in close conact with another person infected with COVID-19 and are not vaccinated, you must stay home to limit exposure. Continue to rest indoors away from others for 14 days since your last suspected exposure. Be sure to monitor your health for symptoms of cronoavirus, such as fever, shortness of breath, and coughing. If at all possible, stay away from others in your household to limit potential spreading of the disease.</p>
          <p class= "mb-2 fw-light">Even if you are fully vaccinated, there is still potential for you to be an asymptomatic carrier. You are not required to quarantine after contact with someone who had COVID-19 unless you display symptoms. Even then, be sure to get tested 5-7 days after exposure even if you have been following all other COVID safety guidelines.</p>
          <li class = "fs-4">Get tested for Covid-19</li>
          <p class= "mb-2 fw-light">Over-the-counter tests can be used anywhere, give rapid results are are easy to use. Consider texting yourself if you suspect that you may have been exposed to COVID-19 to reduce the risk of spreading it. </p>
